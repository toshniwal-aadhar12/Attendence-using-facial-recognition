# Attendence-using-facial-recognition
Marking attendance of the people (along with timestamp) in an excel sheet using facial recognition.

To add a new person to the list you just need to add a picture of the person in the folder and edit the folder name in the main code file. 

Don't forget to save the image file by the name you want to get recorded on the excel sheet.
